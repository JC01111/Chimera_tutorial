#### Follow the same step, you can open another pdb file to compare. <br>
#### Remember! sometimes the protein structure may appear not in the same place, you need to zoom out to find the structure. <br>
*Quick Note: For Mac user, press option to drag the whole picture to move in 2D space. Just moving the mouse can only move the structure in 3D space*
